**Conclusion Issues**
- Swear words are not necessary/sufficient - PROVEN
- DL models outperform ML models
- Oversampling is better due to class imbalance
- Vocab of words used for cyberbullying and their interpretation varies wildly

- word embedding methods have no difference
- no difference between DL models (LSTM generally weaker) against oversampled data

- Task Specific Embedding ????
- TL ????

**Data Issues**
- Twitter data very specifically sourced focusing on keywords which would attract racist and sexist comments (e.g. #notallmen, My Kitchen Rules, Islam Terrorism, etc.)


**Methodology Issues**
Python 2 vs Python 3 (shouldn't be an issue in concept)
TensorFlow vocabulary processor doesn't exist anymore
No train-test split?? Only 5-fold CV - (80/20)
OG People used a Branching CNN instead of a traditional CNN - have changed this as architecture not well-understoof

**Replicability Issues**
Table 1 - Vocab size, unknown
Table 2 - Mostly right, questionable methodology on determination of 'swear word'
Table 3 - Baseline ML model not similar at all (even when copying code)

Next Catchup - 16.01, 10am

TODO - run embedding, get the embedding weights and how to input into Keras model.

Random (BL)
Report (BL)
Recheck CNN (BL)
Glove external embedding (DG)
Word2Vec (IF)

OUTPUT - either something that can go into the DL model, or the embedding layer

TODO - add sklearn wrappers to the four models (BL)
TODO - update template

TODO - setup DL models
TODO - run DL models and get results
TODO - significance testing (BL)

TODO - Understand inputs....
TODO - check if TU cluster has GPU

TASK-SPECIFIC
TRANSFER LEARNING

original encoded data -> EMBEDDING ?? -> embedded data -> own architecture


usually tokenise

BERT - google pre-processing tool (takes in strings) + embedding
Glove - determine what the appropriate inputs are (usually not dictionary) - ANCIENT

Find out what inputs are needed for BERT and glove. build embedder pre-processor
Amend pre-processor to fit with embedding requirements.
